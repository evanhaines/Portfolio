### [Defensive Statistics Impact on NFL Power Ranking - November 2023](pages_NFL.md)
Tools Used - Excel, Power BI

Problem Statement - Which Defensive Statistics are the most impactful when it comes to determining a team's overall power ranking?

My team and I utilized Excel to restrucutre and clean over 600 peices of defensive statistical data gathered from each of the 32 NFL teams throughout the 2021 and 2022 NFL seasons. We also noted the end of regular season power rankings for each team and set this to be the dependent variable within our analysis. We then performed Liner Regression and Data Collinearity within Excel to identify significant independedent variables. We extracted 10 unique variables and used p-values with an alpha value of 0.05 to find the most impactful variables with a 95% confidence interval. Through our analysis we found the following variables to be the most impactful - Fumbles forced per game, interceptions forced per game, and rushing yards allowed per game. With our final data, we crafted various graphs and charts to visualize our findings and presented our work and solution to our TA. I am pleased to say that we recieved an A grade for our project. Months after our grade was received, I added on to the project by creating a PowerBI dashboard to better visualize our findings.
